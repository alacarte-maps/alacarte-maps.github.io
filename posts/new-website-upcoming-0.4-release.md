alaCarte's website was really getting a little outdated and rusty, and instead of updating all the broken things, I
decided to try [nikola][]. It's yet another static site generator written in python, but it currently seems to have more
momentum than [pelican][].

This was done in preparation of the upcoming 0.4 release of alaCarte. In the last few years, quite a few number of
changes have built up and we want to release them as soon as the switch to the upstream dir_monitor library is
completed. See the [changelog][] for a preview of what you can expect in alaCarte 0.4.

As before, if you want to correct or contribute something to the website, you can do so at the
[website source repository][].
