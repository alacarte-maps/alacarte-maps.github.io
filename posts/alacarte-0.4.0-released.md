<!--- git diff (double-hyphen) shortstat v0.3.0 -->
Today we published the [0.4.0 release][] of alaCarte!
In the last three years, quite a few changes accumulated which mainly improve
packaging and using alaCarte. So it was about time, hurray!




## Highlights of the new version: ##

* [Official Windows binaries][]
* For ArchLinux, we now provide the [alacarte-maps AUR package][]
  and the [alacarte-maps-git AUR package][].
* Added documentation for [alacarte-maps-importer][] and [alacarte-maps-server][] binaries in form of man pages.
* Removed dependencies on log4cpp, Cairomm and SigC++.
* Added support for Debian Jessie (as it's the new stable).
* Removed support for Debian Wheezy (as it's now oldstable and its boost version is now too old).

â€¦and of course various bug fixes, build improvements and cleanups.
For details, see the newly-introduced [Changelog][].

If you aren't on Arch Linux or Windows, you can [download the source][]
and follow the [build instructions][] (also found in the included `README.md`).
