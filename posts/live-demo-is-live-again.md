After ten months of downtime, our [Live Demo](/stories/demo.html) is finally up and running
again!

Because of the awesome work of Simon Dreher, who not only fixed his server but also made it publicly available again,
everyone can have a fresh look at alaCarte now, in all it's beauty. ðŸ˜Š

The server runs a pre-release version of alaCarte 0.4 and will be upgraded to our
upcoming Arch Linux AUR package when the next stable version is released.
